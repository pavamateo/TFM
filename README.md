# Trabajo Fin de MÃ¡ster (TFM) - Mateo Pava

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my TFM! This repository serves as a supplementary resource to the main TFM paper. Here, you'll find a information, including code, scripts, and other relevant materials that were pivotal in my research journey.

## Overview

The primary aim of this repository is to provide a comprehensive view of the methodologies, tools, and scripts employed during the research phase of my TFM. By sharing this, I hope to contribute to the scientific community and ensure transparency and reproducibility of my results.

## Contents

1. **Supplementary Information**: Dive deeper into the data with additional tables, figures, and explanations that couldn't be included in the main paper due to space constraints.
  
2. **Code & Scripts**: A collection of all the scripts used for data analysis, data manipulation, and figure generation. This includes:
    - Data preprocessing scripts
    - Analysis pipelines
    - Visualization tools

3. **Data**: Due to data privacy regulations, raw data may not be hosted here. However, where permissible, processed datasets or example datasets have been included for illustrative purposes.

4. **Documentation**: Detailed documentation on how to use the scripts, their dependencies, and any other relevant information.

## Usage

To replicate the analyses or use the scripts:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the respective directories.
3. Follow the instructions in the documentation to set up the environment, install dependencies, and run the scripts.

## Contribution
